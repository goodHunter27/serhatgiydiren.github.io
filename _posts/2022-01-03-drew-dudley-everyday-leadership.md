> Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. It is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light and not our darkness that frightens us.

> We need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives. We need to get over it so we can move beyond it.

> We've made leadership about changing the world, and there is no world. There's only six billion understandings of it. 

> And if you change one person's understanding of it, understanding of what they're capable of, understanding of how much people care about them, understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world, you've changed the whole thing.
