Setting goals can help an organization get to where it wants to be.

Set goals to;
- Align efforts
- Communicate objectives
- Measure process
- Help teams achieve more

Setting challenging and specific goals can further enhance employee engagement in attaining those goals.

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to try to set ambitious goals and track progress.

OKRs at a glance:

- Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable
- Key results are measurable and should be easy to grade with a number
- OKRs are public so that everyone in the organization can see what others are working on
- The "sweet spot" for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren't ambitious enough and they need to think bigger
- Low grades should be viewed as data to help refine the next OKRs
- OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations
- OKRs are not a shared to-do list

Using OKRs is different from other goal-setting techniques because of the aim to set very ambitious goals. When used this way, OKRs can enable teams to focus on the big bets and accomplish more than the team thought was possible, even if they don’t fully attain the stated goal.

OKRs can help teams and individuals get outside of their comfort zones, prioritize work, and learn from both success and failure.

- Where do I want to go? -> Objectives.
- How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? -> Key results / milestones.

**stretch goals** -> goals that are just beyond the threshold of what seems possible -> building blocks for remarkable achievements in the long term

Creating unachievable goals is tricky as it could be seen as setting a team up for failure. However, more often than not, such goals can tend to attract the best people and create the most exciting work environments. Moreover, when aiming high, even failed goals tend to result in substantial advancements.

- success -> achieving 70% of the objectives
- extraordinary performance -> achieving 100% of the objectives
