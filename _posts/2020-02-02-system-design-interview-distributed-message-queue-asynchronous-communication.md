### Asynchronous Communication 

- Queue : Producer sends data to that component and exactly one consumer gets this data to a short time after.
- It is distributed, because data is stored across several machines. 
- Do not confuse queue with topic. In case of a topic, message goes to all subscribers. In case of a queue, message is received by only one consumer.
