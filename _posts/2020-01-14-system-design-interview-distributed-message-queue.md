### Emotional Intelligence: Cultivating Empathy & Compassion

- Sympathy (I feel for you) is the awareness of another's feelings and experiences and understanding that one might help by easing those feelings.
- Empathy (I understand you) takes the feelings and experiences of others and internalizes them, a vicarious experience of another's emotions and situation.
- Compassion (I want to help you) takes it a step further so that empathy then leads to a desire to take action to help alleviate the suffering of another person.
