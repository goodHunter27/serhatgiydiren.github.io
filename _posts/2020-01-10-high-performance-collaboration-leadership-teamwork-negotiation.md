Leaders who can thrive while building strong organizations and creating lasting value. Now the topic of leadership has never been more important. We live in a time of profound change, when the scale and complexity of organizations is greater than ever before. And we need people who are equipped to lead these organizations. 

**Great leadership's all about the people who know how to build effective, resilient organizations. Organizations that don't lose their edge.**

It's important to emphasize that being an effective leader is not about where you sit in an organization. But about how other people view you. **Other people determine whether you're a leader, not your title.**

**Great leadership is all about motivating and inspiring other people to bold and effective action.** Now, to do that, there are two things you need to focus on.

The first is **clarity of purpose**. Great leaders bring an unbelievable focus, to what they're doing at work and why they're doing it. This is because, no matter where you are in an organization, you have to know what your job is, and who benefits when you do your job well. You have to be clear about why you go to work each day. What your role is. How you can deliver on that. In a corporate setting, good ideas are those that reflect a deep understanding of customers' needs and goals. Now this is because in life, every one of us has a customer, we have to make happy. Whether it's your spouse, a parent, a child, maybe it's your best friend and at work we all have customers all the time. Even internally within our own teams. **These are the people whose needs we have to consider, so the clearer we are about whose needs we're here to meet, the more focused we'll be when we're at work.** Despite the endless streams of emails, information and data that come at us every day.

The second theme, **Effective Collaboration**. The rarest skill is the ability to solve problems by working across traditional boundaries. **Now these may be the boundaries that divide us into functional silos, business units, countries, or cultures. But that ability to cross those boundaries I call a deep collaboration.** It's not about being a team player or even a team builder. It's about being a bridge builder. And it's that ability to collaborate not just in your day to day workplace but across boundaries that surround you. That's critically important.

------------------------------

Leadership requires the ability to look at complex problems and to uncover root causes. To see the central idea in a sea of issues. However, leadership is more than chasing and solving problems. To either see new possibilities where others are not looking. And recognize when new ideas can have broad implications.

These two core skills, problem solving and imagining the future, can be addressed through one process, design innovation. At it's core, most basic level, **design innovation starts with a clear understanding of the end user**. It uses as systematic process to uncover the real problem behind the perceived problem. In design, the majority of the time is spent on building understanding, because there is no big price for solving correctly what turns out to be the wrong question. Through the design process we build, test and iterate, all while keeping the end user in mind. Design innovation empowers leaders to develop meaningful solutions, create value, and envision new possibilities. At the very highest level, design unlocks creativity and the ability to imagine a new future. Design also serves as an important counterbalance to an overly analytical mindset. It is not an either or proposition. You need both analysis and creativity. But combining these two will empower the development of transformative ideas. It is something that we call whole brain thinking.

We need accurate information to make decisions, and we need to communicate well to be leaders. **Your story, how you connect with internal and external groups, can be a key to the success of your organization.** And great story tellers can lead groups through challenges, away from conflict, and toward innovation.

I'm acutely aware of the connection between well-executed communication and effective leadership. As a leader you need to be able to articulate an effective vision for your organization, and help others adopt and implement it. And while these days a leader has many possible ways of sharing ideas with others in his or her organization. In the end a leader's effectiveness will turn on the ability to influence others through persuasion.

------------------------------

**There are three key cornerstones to leadership, and it starts with you. The first one is all about you becoming a leader. The second is collaboration and teams ultimately we take a deep dive into negotiations and conflict management.**

**Everyone is able to overcome nature through practice, learning, dedication, and motivation.**

An enduring question when it comes to leadership is, are leaders born? Or are they made? There are two dominant theories.

**Entity theory, also known as trait theory, or the great man theory of leadership, argues that leadership is a trait, or set of abilities that one is either born with, or not.**

**Incremental theory argues that leadership is not a trait, but rather, an acquired skill, and is highly influenced by the environment.**

The firm belief that anyone who is intent upon improving their leadership can improve dramatically.

------------------------------

According to Carol Dweck, there are two fundamental mindsets that people have when it comes to looking at themselves and others. She calls these Fixed and Growth mindsets.

People who have a fixed mindset believe that intelligence, personality, talents, and skills are largely carved in stone and unchangeable. In some situations, this could set one's self up for success or guaranteed failure. People with fixed mindsets don't like trying new things because the risk of failure looms large.

In contrast, people who have a growth mindset don't see intelligence, personality, talent, and skills as fixed or stable.
Rather, they see themselves as having potential, and even more important, they see others as having potential.

What are the implications of a growth versus fixed mindset?

First in terms of bouncing back from hardship, people who have a growth mindset are more resilient.

Second in terms of happiness, people with growth mindsets are happier and less depressed.

Third in terms of facing challenge and adversity people with growth mindsets are more persistent.

Let's talk about failure for a moment. Failures are unpleasant, but they grab our attention and focus us to integrate new information.

**According to post-traumatic growth theory, we should hope for exposure to failure early and often.**

**As leaders, we can cultivate growth mindsets in our teams by how we describe challenges as a test of DNA or as an opportunity to learn. Knowing how to fail is a key leadership skill.**

------------------------------

According to McGregor there are two fundamentally different kinds of leadership styles, Theory X and Theory Y.

Theory X leadership is largely transactional. Meaning that leaders believe people are fundamentally not motivated and they need to be offered incentives or punishments to perform. Theory X leaders believe that people need to be monitored, and that good work should be rewarded, and bad work or lack of work needs to be punished. All of this amounts to a tit-for-tat culture.

Theory Y leadership, which is based on the outlandish idea that people want to contribute and are self motivated to perform good work. Theory Y leaders are transformational, meaning that they inspire people to excel and contribute, not by administering rewards and punishments, but by empowering others and giving them authority. This creates a gift culture, where people are not adding up cost and
benefits, but they are actively contributing to the enterprise.

Another question, when it comes to leadership is, should managers focus on getting the work done or attending to the people?

Task-focused leaders are highly agentic and focus on getting the work done, meeting performance objectives, and being productive.

In contrast, person-focused leaders care about the people, their welfare, and seek to build trusting relationships with them.

**Blake and Mouton's leadership grid to explore five possible types of leaders.**

The Authority-Obedience Manager is high task, low people. The Authority-Obedience leader focuses so much on the task, that people often don't feel appreciated.

The Country-Club leader focuses so much on the people that no work is getting done.

The Impoverished leader is low people, low task, and is not really doing anything.

Team Managers are high people and high task. Team leaders focus both on the people and the work to be done.

Most of us tend to be Middle of the Road Managers. We know we should be attending to the task and the people, but we're falling short.

Hershey and Blanchard realized that because organizations and companies face different challenges and situations change, leaders need to be ready to respond, pivot and adjust. So they developed the **Situational Leadership Model**.

According to the Situational Leadership Model, leaders need to consider the readiness of their team in regard to the task.

If your team is not ready to perform the task, low readiness, leaders need to be very directing, what Blake and Mouton referred to as authority obedience leadership.

If teams are very ready, leaders can delegate because the team can handle the rest.

When team members are moderately ready when it comes to the task, leaders can do more supporting and coaching.

**Intrinsic motivation** refers to motivation and desire that is driven by internal rewards which can be a sense of satisfaction, accomplishment, or making the world a better place.

**Extrinsic motivation** refers to motivation and desire that is driven by the promise of external rewards including money, resources, or material gain.

How might leaders use intrinsic goals to motivate employees?

First, there are two fundamental types of motivations, intrinsic and extrinsic.

Second, most leaders falsely believe others are exclusively motivated by extrinsic reasons but that they themselves are uniquely by motivated by intrinsic reasons.

Third, failing to affirm intrinsic interest can undermine motivation.

Finally, affirming intrinsic motivation can lead to greater insight and better performance.

It's important to realize that happiness is not a state that we fall into. Rather, evidence indicates that happiness can be a cultivated activity.

Let's first talk about the determinants of happiness.

By some accounts, 50% of your overall happiness is genetically determined. In other words, that means each of us may have a set point.

Only about 10% of happiness is determined by life circumstances. AKA, material wealth, marriage, employment status, income, and possessions. Buying that new Tesla certainly does make us happy for about two weeks. But then we quickly adjust and adapt. Why? It's because of something known as the hedonic treadmill, meaning once we acquire a new salary or a new possession, we experience a noticeable increase in pleasure. We're thrilled. We're excited. However, very quickly, in about one to two weeks, we adapt to those new pleasures. And then we feel like we need to capture the next car, the next house, the next job.

Now the best news, 40% of our happiness is determined by intentional activity. Behaviors and practices that we voluntarily pursue, such as helping others, adopting a positive attitude. Exercise and striving for goals. These behaviors are strongly resistant to the effects of adaptation.

Happy people perform better at work.

Happy people are less likely to get sick.

Happy people are less likely to suffer from debilitating diseases.

Happy people are better organizational citizens.

And, happy people have better social relationships.

Unhappy people are absent more often from work.

They change jobs more often.

They're less cooperative.

They're less helpful.

And they perform worse.

They negatively affect the loyalty of customers and clients.

**Leaders with positive moods were particularly contagious and effected the positivity of others and their groups.**

Okay, so what to do? Treat happiness like your exercise routine. Commit to it, and work on it.

------------------------------

Human overconfidence, a type of egocentric bias. The unwarranted belief in one's own decision prowess.

The fact is, most people are wildly overconfident about their decision-making abilities.

Unfortunately, the biases that leaders and managers hold, can wreak havoc on their teams. Let's talk about five biases and how to neutralize them.

**The framing effect**. According to Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman, most decision-makers are **risk-averse** when it comes to good things. Making money, saving lives. But are **risk-seeking** when it comes to negative things. This may seem like a harmless quirk of human behavior, but the framing effect means that you can be easily manipulated or manipulate others.

**Confirmation bias**, is essentially the tendency for people to seek information that confirms what they want to believe. The problem at the core was the fact that leaders turned a blind eye to signs and signals that they didn't want to see.

**Decision fatigue**. Did you know that the very act of making decisions produces fatigue? However unlike physical exertion where we know we are tired, leaders are often unaware that they are mentally fatigued and they become organizationally dangerous. For this reason, truly effective leaders know their limits.

**The team scaling fallacy**. As team size increases, people increasingly underestimate the number of labor hours required to complete the project. Did you know that most projects are delivered late and over budget? The remedy is to base forecasts on milestones, not the entire project and factor in obstacles.

**Common information effect** is the tendency for groups to discuss information that they all have in common, rather than unique information. The teams had a bias toward discussing information, clues, and assumptions they had in common. They were much less likely to discuss information they were uniquely aware of. Their remedy is to suspend initial judgment, consider the alternatives one at a time, and
find out who has information that is not shared by all group members.

Think about a decision you're making or facing right now. Leaving your job, buying a company, starting a new venture. Here are four action steps.

First, build in tests of disconfirmation. What could prove you wrong? Reward team members for providing controversial data.

Two, set up policies in advance of obtaining outcomes.

Three, bring in outsiders to evaluate, but don't tell them your preferred course of action.

Finally, turn off the email inbox so you're not tempted to divert your attention or make trivial decisions before facing a big decision.

------------------------------

I want you to think about the best boss, leader, or mentor you've ever had, past or present, okay? Do you have that person in mind? Good, what key quality did this leader possess that was so important for you? I've asked this question in many of my executive courses, and no one has ever said my best boss was really intelligent, or my boss had a perfect GMAT score. Instead, they mention people skills.

Leaders are judged, not just by how smart they are, but how they handle themselves and others. The skill that involves how to work with other people and how to manage yourself is known as emotional intelligence.

There are four skills of emotional intelligence, **self awareness**, **other awareness**, also known as empathy, **self management**, and **relationship management**.

**Self-awareness** is all about understanding ourselves and seeing ourselves as others see us. People who are high in self-awareness recognize the emotions they experience, the factors that lead to these emotions, and how they are perceived by others. A 360-Degree Evaluation is a modern day form of organizational torture.

**Self-management** focuses on how to appropriately regulate our emotions, particularly negative ones. According to emotional intelligence guru Daniel Goleman of Harvard, people often have Amygdala Hijacks which are, essentially, adult temper tantrums. An Amygdala Hijack occurs when people exhibit an emotional response that is immediate, overwhelming and out of measure with the actual stimulus. Self-Management or self-regulation of negative emotions is a key leadership skill, perhaps even a key survival skill in the age of the ever present video camera and cell phone.

Successful leaders have self implemented their own way to deal with frustration, anger, etc., before it becomes an ill-fated, career defining move. For example, one senior leader at a national laboratory takes his dog on a walk before responding to emails that are upsetting. Another senior leader at a major company meditates for 30 minutes every day. Yet another leader engages in cognitive reappraisal. She identifies the situation she is facing that is most disconcerting or upsetting. For example, instead of looking at an upcoming job interview as a test of her ability, she redefines it as a chance to network.

What are the implications for leadership? First, emotional intelligence starts with self-awareness. Second, people who are high in self-awareness are more empathic. Finally, you can improve your ability to self-regulate with rehearsal and practice.

Jim McNerney, CEO of Boeing, states that the biggest jump into the CEO job is learning to manage what you can't control having been trained to manage what you can control.
 
Your human capital is the sum total of your skills, talents, and abilities, based upon your education and experience. This is what is often found on resumes. Your organizational capital is the value you bring to your organization in terms of the relationships you build and maintain in and outside of the organization.

Organizational charts are rather crude depictions that reveal the chain of command and reporting relationships. However, as many managers can attest, the way that work actually gets done and information gets spread within an organization is a far cry from published organizational charts. Instead, informal systems of connections and relationships developed over time, guide the flow of information. Let's call these **informal networks**.

Let's look at two hypothetical people who have the same job in the same organization.

Ed has about four trusted advisors. Who he seeks for counsel and advice. Those trusted advisors are connected to each other as well. Thus, this is a very dense network. Ed has a network of relatively close colleges most likely from the same functional unit. This type of close knit self-contained network ia a clique network of closed-loop network. In the closed-loop network the members know one another quite well and communication is largely redundant.

Mike's network is very different.

First, Mike's network is much less tightly knit than Ed's network.

Second, Mike's network spans what appears to be more functional units than Ed's network.

Mike also has about the same number of trusted advisors. But, unlike Ed's network, Mike's trusted advisors are not directly connected to each other. Instead, they are connected to each other through Mike.

Finally, Mike's network is more structurally unique than Ed's. This means that Mike has relationships with people that no one else has.

There are some leadership and communication lessons to be learned here.

First, people who span organizational divides and integrate knowledge and best practices around the organization are known as **boundary-spanners**. They are the Mikes of the organization, and they connect people and ideas.

Second, the gaps in organizations are structural holes, and unless people like Mike are filling them, knowledge is literally falling through the cracks, and we have silos in the organization.

Third, the structural holes that exist between people, functional units, and teams represent opportunities for leaders. Indeed boundary spanners with larger networks of otherwise disconnected contacts get promoted earlier than comparable managers with smaller networks of interconnected contacts.

What can you do to increase your own organizational intelligence?

First and foremost, analyze your own organizational network. Who are your trusted advisors?

Second, who are your boundary-spanners. Who are the Mikes in your own network? Are you nurturing those relationships, or are you letting them stagnate?

Finally, where are the structural holes in your organization? How can you act as a bridge between people and groups that should be connected? But are not.

What is culture? Culture is the personality of a group. Cultural intelligence according to Professor Chris Earley, is a persons capability to adapt effectively to new cultural contexts. The risk of talking about culture is that we may fall prey to stereotyping people.

A stereotype is a faulty belief that everyone from a given group or given culture is the same. No one wants to be stereotyped. Instead, let’s talk about prototypes when it comes to culture. A prototype is a central tendency. In other words, a prototype acknowledges that there may be a norm in a given culture, but there is variation and dispersion around that norm.

Let's think about culture like an iceberg. As you know, about one-ninth of an iceberg is exposed above the water. Eight-ninth's is below the surface. When we meet someone from a different culture, we see their appearance and behaviors. We don't see their values, beliefs, and norms.

Let's talk about three key cultural prototypes, as identified by Professor Jean Brett in her book Negotiating Globally, face, honor, and dignity cultures.

Face cultures are primarily East Asia, but not exclusively. People from face cultures derive their self worth from earning the respect of others. If you agree with statements like, people should be humble to maintain good relationships, and, it is important to never criticize others, particularly superiors in public. You embrace the face culture. In terms of confrontation style, face cultures are indirect and will usually refer to superiors. With regard to power and status, people in face cultures are often embedded in stable, hierarchical relationships.

Dignity cultures are primarily Europe North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but not exclusively. There are always exceptions. People who embody the dignity culture believe strongly in speaking their mind and being self-reliant. Their own self worth is self determined and they are very comfortable engaging in direct, rational, fact-based conversation. Status and titles are not nearly as important for people in dignity cultures, as information and talent. Our cultural values affect how we motivate people in our organizations. A small Texas corporation seeking to elevate productivity told its employees to look into the mirror each day and say, I am beautiful, 100 times before coming to work. Dignity culture. Employees of a Japanese owned company in New Jersey were instructed to begin the day by holding hands, and telling each other that he or she is beautiful. Face culture.

Honor cultures are primarily in the Middle East, South Asia, North Africa, and Latin America. Self-worth in honor cultures is socially claimed. The confrontation style of honor cultures is to express emotion, and if necessary, take matters into your own hands. If you agree with statements like, people need to defend their family, and, it is important not to let others insult your reputation, you embrace the honor culture.

There are three primary cultural personalities, learn to recognize them. Some of us are multicultural. It is vital to realize that your own cultural beliefs may not be embraced by others. Decide how much you are willing to change when communicating globally.
