* Leadership here at Google is important at every level. Leadership can take many forms. And every Googler, no matter their job or level, has leadership qualities.
* No matter which role you're interviewing for, we will be evaluating you on communication and leadership style, working with teams, vision, navigating complexity and ambiguity, and delivering results.

### Communication and Leadership Style

* Communication is incredibly important in the work we do at Google.
* It plays a significant role in how we approach developing and building our products.
* In your interview, it's important to illustrate your communication skills and style as a leader with examples from your past.
* Googlers expect leaders to be authentic, transparent, humble, and technically knowledgeable,no matter your level or role.
* They will want to know the "why" behind your decision-making.
* And they may challenge you on some of your choices — which is why it's important that you're open to leading and working with diverse teams whose views may be very different from yours.
* As a leader, we don't expect you to always be the most knowledgeable person in the room.
* And we know you won't always have the answer to every question.
* But we do expect you to seek out and work with the teams or individuals who are the best-suited partners to solve a problem or make a decision.

### Navigating Complexity and Ambiguity

* At Google we look to solve complex problems at a global scale.
* And this can often put you and your teams in ambiguous situations.
* A strong leader keeps an open mind, understands the larger picture, and always goes out of their way to communicate those big decisions.
* You want to make sure no one is left in the dark.
* Strong leaders are also able to identify and manage the needs of internal and external stakeholders, while keeping your own team's projects in mind.
* It's very likely that someone from another team would come to you and ask for work that's critical to their project.
* And that could stretch you and your team thin.
* Knowing how to balance these requests with your teams' priorities is a necessary skill to leading at Google.

### Working with Teams

* For our products to be successful, we need teams who are inspired to innovate.
* During your interview, we want to hear about the times when you've shown team members that you value their perspectives, even when they are different from your own.
* Leaders at Google create an open and inclusive environment through clear communication and by showing respect for each individual's opinion.
* Explain to us how you handle these situations with understanding and care, and how you avoided escalating the issue.

### Vision

* One of the many reasons people work here is because they have a vision of changing the world, to make it better.
* As a leader, it's your job to help shape that vision.
* To do that, you'll need to be ready to answer these questions:
* Have you formulated your team mission?
* Who are the users of your product?
* And, what are you solving for?
* But that's not all.
* We are always challenging the status quo and rethinking how we do things.
* You should be prepared to think outside of the box and share examples of your vision and product thinking.

### Delivering Results

* Having a vision and expressing it well aren't worth much if the team can't translate that into concrete goals.
* So, we will be evaluating you on your project management skills and how you deliver results.
* We'll be looking for: how you define clear goals, develop a plan, delegate tasks, manage progress and maintain the team's focus.
* At Google, we aim to eliminate as much process overhead as possible.
* That's because we value a results-driven environment rather than one driven by process.
* Therefore, finding the right balance between process and flexibility can be viewed as one aspect of the art of leadership.
* On one hand, you want to remain adaptable and ensure enough space for creativity.
* On the other hand, you still want measurable results in the end and consistent tracking helps that.
* Be prepared to explain how you'd balance process and getting the results you need.

### Best Practices

* Now that you have the focus areas, here are some overall best practices to keep in mind for your actual interview day.
* We want to understand how you think and how you make decisions, so it's important to explain your thought process during the interview.
* Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to give us an idea of how you solve problems.
* We encourage you to ask for clarification.
* And lastly, it's important for us to hear how you've improved as a leader over time.
* So share with us the moments when you didn't get it right, what you learned and how you've grown.
* And those are our tips to help you prepare for the leadership components of your interview at Google!
