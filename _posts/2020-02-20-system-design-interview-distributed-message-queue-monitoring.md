### Monitoring

- Monitoring is critical for every system.
- With regards to distributed message queue, we need to monitor components (or microservices) that we built: fronted, metadata and backend services.
- As well as provide visibility into customer's experience.
- In other words, we need to monitor health of our distributed queue system and give customers ability to track state of their queues.
- Each service we built has to emit metrics and write log data.
- As operators of these services we need to create dashboards for each microservice and setup alerts.
- And customers of our queue have to be able to create dashboards and set up alerts as well.
- For this purpose, integration with monitoring system is required.
