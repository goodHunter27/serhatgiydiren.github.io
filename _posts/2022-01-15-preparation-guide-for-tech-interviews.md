# General Interview Tips

**Explain** - We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember we're not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable. 

**Clarify** - Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We're looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification. 

**Improve** - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It's worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it - just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why. 

**Practice** - You won't have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it's easily readable without bugs. Don't stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.

# Leadership Interviews

Beyond the technical preparation, you’ll also be asked questions on leading teams and projects. People management interviews dive into how you would support and grow your teams, covering: 

**Leadership** - Be prepared to show examples of how you've resolved complex situations. How did you ensure you dealt with team challenges in a balanced way? You may also be asked some more hypothetical questions, so be prepared to talk through how you would influence, solve problems and drive improvements. How would you take ownership and stay creative while moving quickly? 

**Working with people & teams** - Think about how you develop and retain team members. How would you address a skills gap or personality conflict? How would you ensure your team is diverse and inclusive? How could you spot burn out? How would you organize day to day work activities? How would you convince a team to adopt a new technology?  

**Googleyness** - We also want to make sure this is a place you'll thrive, so we'll be looking for signs around your comfort with ambiguity, your bias to action and your collaborative nature. Be prepared to talk about how you would support a team to help them navigate tough challenges and changes. Think about how to effectively lead in a non-hierarchical team environment and what your personal leadership style is.  

**Applying the right framework** - What's your personal Project Management philosophy? How do you apply your framework to projects you manage? Be prepared to explain and justify your methodology. Be able to discuss and compare different project management methodologies and their relative merits (e.g. tradeoffs between flexibility and process in an agile environment). Why did you use a particular approach?  

**Navigating complexity and ambiguity** - How do you deal with ambiguous situations and problems? How do you handle projects without defined end dates? How would you prioritize multiple projects of varying complexity? How do you balance process versus execution? What are signals that too much or too little process is in place? Can you give examples of projects where you demonstrated leadership even if you weren't a formal manager?  

**Delivering results** - Give examples of projects where you were the end-to-end owner. How do you evaluate the success or failure of a project? What are some strategies for handling competing visions on how to execute a project? Be prepared to discuss how to use data effectively to move critical decisions forward and how to measure impact.
