# General Interview Tips

**Explain** - We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember we're not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable. 

**Clarify** - Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We're looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification. 

**Improve** - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It's worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it — just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why. 

**Practice** - You won't have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it's easily readable without bugs. Don't stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.
