# General Interview Tips

**Explain** - We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember we're not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable. 

**Clarify** - Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We're looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification. 

**Improve** - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It's worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it - just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why. 

**Practice** - You won't have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it's easily readable without bugs. Don't stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.

# Leadership Interviews

Beyond the technical preparation, you'll also be asked questions on leading teams and projects. People management interviews dive into how you would support and grow your teams, covering: 

**Leadership** - Be prepared to show examples of how you've resolved complex situations. How did you ensure you dealt with team challenges in a balanced way? You may also be asked some more hypothetical questions, so be prepared to talk through how you would influence, solve problems and drive improvements. How would you take ownership and stay creative while moving quickly? 

**Working with people & teams** - Think about how you develop and retain team members. How would you address a skills gap or personality conflict? How would you ensure your team is diverse and inclusive? How could you spot burn out? How would you organize day to day work activities? How would you convince a team to adopt a new technology?  

**Googleyness** - We also want to make sure this is a place you'll thrive, so we'll be looking for signs around your comfort with ambiguity, your bias to action and your collaborative nature. Be prepared to talk about how you would support a team to help them navigate tough challenges and changes. Think about how to effectively lead in a non-hierarchical team environment and what your personal leadership style is.  

**Applying the right framework** - What's your personal Project Management philosophy? How do you apply your framework to projects you manage? Be prepared to explain and justify your methodology. Be able to discuss and compare different project management methodologies and their relative merits (e.g. tradeoffs between flexibility and process in an agile environment). Why did you use a particular approach?  

**Navigating complexity and ambiguity** - How do you deal with ambiguous situations and problems? How do you handle projects without defined end dates? How would you prioritize multiple projects of varying complexity? How do you balance process versus execution? What are signals that too much or too little process is in place? Can you give examples of projects where you demonstrated leadership even if you weren't a formal manager?  

**Delivering results** - Give examples of projects where you were the end-to-end owner. How do you evaluate the success or failure of a project? What are some strategies for handling competing visions on how to execute a project? Be prepared to discuss how to use data effectively to move critical decisions forward and how to measure impact.  

## STAR Method  

The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing.  

**Situation:** Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description  of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.  

**Task:** What goal were you working toward?  

**Action:** Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.  

**Result:** Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.  

Make sure that you follow all parts of the STAR method. Be as specific as possible at all times, without rambling or including too much information. Oftentimes students have to be prompted to include their results, so try to include that without being asked. Also, eliminate any examples that do not paint you in a positive light. However, keep in mind that some examples that have a negative result (such as "lost the game") can highlight your strengths in the face of adversity.  

### Sample STAR Response: 

**Situation (S):** Advertising revenue was falling off for my college newspaper, The Review, and large numbers of long-term advertisers were not renewing contracts. 

**Task (T):** My goal was to generate new ideas, materials and incentives that would result in at least a 15% increase in advertisers from the year before. 

**Action (A):** I designed a new promotional packet to go with the rate sheet and compared the benefits of The Review circulation with other ad media in the area. I also set-up a special training session for the account executives with a School of Business Administration professor who discussed competitive selling strategies.  

**Result (R):** We signed contracts with 15 former advertisers for daily ads and five for special supplements. We increased our new advertisers by 20 percent over the same period last year. 

## How to prepare for a behavioral interview 

*   Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions, especially involving course work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service.
*   Prepare short descriptions of each situation; be ready to give details if asked.
*   Be sure each story has a beginning, middle, and an end, i.e., be ready to describe the situation, including the task at hand, your action, and the outcome or result.
*   Be sure the outcome or result reflects positively on you (even if the result itself was not favorable).
*   Be honest. Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your story is built on a weak foundation.
*   Be specific. Don't generalize about several events; give a detailed accounting of one event.
*   Vary your examples; don't take them all from just one area of your life.

* Please tell me about a time you had to fire a friend.
* Describe a time when you set your sights too high (or too low).

# Coding & Algorithm Interviews

**Coding** - You should know at least one programming language really well, preferably C++, Java, Python, Go, or C. You will be expected to know APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code. Note that we focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorization.  

**Algorithms** - Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve / change it. Algorithms that are used to solve Google problems include sorting (plus searching and binary search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming / memoization, greediness, recursion or algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Know Big-O notations (e.g. run time) and be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. We recommend discussing or outlining the algorithm you have in mind before writing code.  

**Sorting** - Be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they're efficient or ineffcient. Think about efficiency means in terms of runtime and space used. For example, in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic QuickSort / MergeSort / HeapSort answers.  

**Data structures** - You should study up on as many data structures as possible. Data structures most frequently used are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash-sets, hash-maps, hash-tables, dictionary, trees and binary trees, heaps and graphs. You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.  

**Mathematics** - Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because counting problems, probability problems and other Discrete Math 101 situations surround us. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.  

**Graphs** - Consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection, etc. There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) — familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.  

**Recursion** - Many coding problems involve thinking recursively and potentially coding a recursive solution. Use recursion to find more elegant solutions to problems that can be solved iteratively.

# System Design Interviews

## What is a system design question and why is it important?  

System design questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to combine knowledge, theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem. Sample topics include feature sets, interfaces, class hierarchies, constraints, simplicity, robustness and tradeoffs. The interview will assess your deep understanding of how the internet works and familiarity with the various pieces (routers, domain name servers, load balancers, firewalls, etc.).  

## Interview Tips and Expectations:  

1.  The system design question will ask you to take an abstract question in a formerly unseen problem and present a high level framework to solve the presented problem. In doing so, follow these steps:
     *   Gather key requirements 
     *   Identify key design elements 
     *   Identify tradeoffs of different decisions 
     *   Dive deep into a specific sub-problem AND/OR demonstrate what process to use to arrive at a solution 

2.  Identify the major components of an overall system design and deeply describe at least two of them. Suggest which technologies and systems should be used to solve a relatively common problem (i.e. relational database, document-based database, etc.), and if relevant, share a story about a time you have solved a problem using these technologies.  

3.  When defining a system, include as many non-functional requirements as possible. For example: performance, latency, legal, privacy, maintainability, capacity, security, geographic, and cross-DC consideration.  

4.  Develop a framework you can use to answer most questions.  

5.  Approach the problem with an open mind: Be mindful that your familiarity (if any) with the problem may make you take shortcuts (even verbal ones when explaining your approach); the interviewer may not share the same context as you. If there is a more succinct approach, feel free to explain to the interviewer the route you’re taking and the context behind why.  

6.  Problem Solve: The interviewers are looking for problem solving and approach as much as they are assessing your solution. So, ask clarifying questions about the problem, express ideas verbally, and think out loud. Constantly challenge your own design. Be prepared to justify every decision you make. Practice going through problems with a friend. 

7.  Listen: Design questions are typically open-ended and the problem may be ambiguous. If the interviewer gives a hint or asks a question while you are solving the problem, listen intently and do not ignore. They are most likely trying to guide you or looking for a particular awareness.  

## Role-related design questions  

Due to the wide variety of projects we offer at Google, it is important our design questions are relevant to both your background and the role you will be exploring. Be sure to discuss with your recruiter the role you're pursuing and which system design question is best suited to assess your skills. Depending on your area of expertise, one of the following types of design questions will be asked:

### Distributed System Design 

System design is a general category which means "big enough systems that you have to operate on a high level of abstraction to get the basic architecture down." A distributed system question is related to problems of coordination between autonomous systems while system design can include problems constrained to a single execution.  

Distributed systems questions focus on cross-task coordination, communication, synchronization, and failure modes. System design questions are more weighted toward managing the complexity of large bodies of software. You can find some of the Google research around distributed systems here.

**Example Distributed System Design:** Design a distributed unique ID service.

### Low Level System Design

This type of system design question is typically asked when exploring our embedded software engineering roles here at Google. Expect a very broad question that doesn't have a single right answer but can go in a number of directions. Your interviewer will probably drill down in more detail in a few areas.  

A low level system design interview covers areas of design that span issues of scaling, details of integration with hardware and integration with higher level components. You might come across questions that relate to OTAs, boot, reliability, power management, the kinds of issues that any low-level team will be dealing with on a constant basis. The interview will assess understanding of high level concepts, file storage, encryption, signing, how devices boot, how disks are laid out, how power management functions, etc.  

**Example Low Level Design:** Design an automated failover system for a replicated database. 

### Machine Learning Design 

Candidates who have experience with Machine Learning technologies may be asked a Machine Learning design question. These questions are generally open ended so you can dive deeper into the solution. It is important to design a solution thinking about data analysis, potential use cases, the users, scalability, limitations and tradeoffs. The Machine Learning Design question may focus on one specialization within machine learning. These may include computer vision, deep learning/neural networks, recommendations/ranking systems, natural language processing, speech/audio or reinforcement learning.  

**Example Machine Learning Design:** Design a near-duplicate image detection system.  

### Mobile Application System Design 

Mobile application design questions are targeted toward mobile focused candidates (iOS and Android developers). A mobile application design interview gives the candidate a chance to display their design skills within this domain. The goal of a design interview is to assess your ability to combine knowledge, theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem. Interviewers may ask the candidate to specify the design of an entire mobile application, subsystems within a specific application or a solution to a difficult aspect of mobile application development.  

Reflect on the design decisions you've made in the past and think about the justifications and rationale for those design details. Study any published and available designs for mobile application problems. Think in some detail about how you would architect some of the applications that you use often and are familiar with. Practice with top-down and bottom-up design approaches and consider how various layers of a system interact with each other.  

**Example Application System Design:** How would you speed up the startup time for the YouTube app?  

### Front End UI Web Design 

A front end design interview will typically involve problems that require an understanding of key front end concepts such as web serving systems, client-side technologies and languages, and common design patterns for UI development.  

The problem analysis could involve a break-down into sub-problems, identification of areas of risk, or a discussion of requirements and goals. The solution could involve (but not limited to!) system diagrams, state diagrams, data-structures, or algorithms. Explaining the solution crisply is as important as coming up with the solution, and informs us how well candidates are able to collaborate. Code may be involved to describe a solution, but this may not be the objective. In some cases, a portion of a design problem may translate into a coding a problem.  

**Example Front End UI Web Design:** Design a web system to sell concert tickets.
