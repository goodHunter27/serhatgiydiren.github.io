### Emotional Intelligence: Cultivating Empathy & Compassion

- Sympathy (I feel for you) is the awareness of another's feelings and experiences and understanding that one might help by easing those feelings.
- Empathy (I understand you) takes the feelings and experiences of others and internalizes them, a vicarious experience of another's emotions and situation.
- Compassion (I want to help you) takes it a step further so that empathy then leads to a desire to take action to help alleviate the suffering of another person.

**the Golden Rule is to Empathy**
**...as the Platinum Rule is to Compassion**

How can I cultivate compassion?
- Ask how you can help, don’t assume you know what’s wanted
- Look for commonalities with your directs
- Encourage cooperation instead of competition in your team
- Cultivate a genuine curiosity about the individuals on your team
- Lead by example- treating others with compassion is contagious!
- Be mindful of boundaries— avoid being an emotional sponge

Why cultivate compassion?
- Too much empathy can cause stress & burnout for the empathizer
- Same brain regions are activated in the person suffering & empathizing
- VS. compassion, which instead produces feelings of concern, warmth, and motivation to help the other person
- Compassion training can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, and may even reduce your risk of heart disease 

Four Types of Reappraisal
- Reinterpreting : How can I take the threat away from this situation?
- Normalizing : It's OK because others feel this way too
- Reordering : I'm going to think about the value I’m putting on this
- Repositioning : I'm going to consider this from another perspective

### Coaching Skills and GROW (Goal - Reality - Options - Will) Mode

Coaching is unlocking a person's potential to maximize their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.

When should I coach?
- When working with high-potentials : Coaching fosters their long-term development
- When working with knowledge workers : The "expert" leadership role has limitations when workers may be more knowledgeable than the boss
- When commitment trumps control : When securing employees' commitment and intrinsic motivation is more important than controlling them, coaching is the best approach
- When the issue is around managing relationships : e.g. stakeholder management, how to motivate others

When Should Coaching be Avoided?
- When dealing with serious underperformers : Coaching is not a performance plan
- When you do have the answers. If you know exactly how work must be done, direct instruction is better than inquiry : If a question has just one answer, people feel quizzed
- When task control is more important than commitment : In doing routine tasks for example, this may be the case
- If the coach believes the coachee cannot achieve the goal : An important aspect of coaching is having a growth mindset. If this is the case, question yourassessment before acting.
- When there are safetyor legal risks involved

**True coaching does not happen often, because most of us find it hard to stop giving advice.**

- Best Questions: WHAT and HOW
- Info Questions: WHO, WHEN, WHERE
- Less: WHY

- Be fully present for and focused on the coachee
- Be aware of your own mindset and that of the coachee
- Practice empathic listening(aka active or reflective listening)
- Ask open-ended questions to facilitate coachee's own insight

### Stage 1 – GOAL (you want)

Help coachee articulate a specific meaningful goal, including what success would look like. It's rare to uncover the most meaningful / impactful goal in the first telling. It is the coach's job to delve more deeply to clarify the goal further.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- What do you want, desire, or need to overcome?
- What are your interests, values and motivations?
- What will success or achievement look or feel like?
- When will you know you have succeeded?
- How will you know you have succeeded?
- How important is this to you?

### Stage 2 – REALITY (of today)

Help coachee articulate the "here and now" so s/he can map the journey to the goal. Watch for trying to gather too much data; as coach you only need to understand general dynamics, how coachee interprets the situation, and the impact on him/her. Provide objectivity and invite coachee to see the situation from different angles.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- Where are you now with this topic?
- What makes you think that?
- What would your peers say about it?
- What obstacles are currently in the way of your success?
- What resources do you need to achieve your goal?

### Stage 3 – OPTIONS (for action)

Help coachee brainstorm a list of potential actions to move toward goal. Go for quantity rather than quality of ideas; quality eval comes later. Encourage creativity and brainstorm ALL potential ways to achieve goal before deciding on actions. Offer your ideas after coachee exhausts his/hers. Attribute equal weight to all ideas.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- If your biggest obstacle wasn't there, what would you do?
- If you had endless resources, what would you do?
- What would your best friend, manager, or peer want or do in this situation?
- What can you do right now to further develop skills that would be useful in reaching your goal?
- What have helpful mentors done that has helped you progress?

### Stage 4 – WILL (take these steps)

Help coachee determine specific action plan s/he "owns" and follows to achieve the goal. This stage is about forward momentum and converting the discussion to a decision. Allow coachee to select relevant actions and decide how they want to be accountable.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS

- What will you do?
- On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to doing this? (If 6 or below, ask what would bring them to an 8-10.)
- What obstacles could arise? How will you overcome them?
- When will you start?
- How will you and I know it's been achieved or completed?
- Who will you ask for feedback after you've taken action?
- What advocacy would help? How can I provide more support towards your development?

Focused attention on coaching is more important than the time spent. What matters most is listening so the other person feels heard. Eliminate distractions and cultivate a sense of presence in the moment.

### Decision Making Styles

Tell (Let's do X)
- **Time critical; leader retains all control of final decision**
- Simple decision that needs to be acted on quickly
- Limited impact to team
- Leader has sufficient data or knows pertinent information
- Members' interests or objectivity will be compromised

Consult (Thanks for your input. I propose X. Anyone disagree?)
- **Time critical; leader retains all control of final decision**
- Ideas that need to be tested across the team
- Decision has greater impact on team, so involvement is necessary
- Members or others have expertise
- Leader has ideas they explicitly want input on before deciding
- Decision that needs greater buy-in and support

Delegate (I'd like [Person A] to look into this then tell me [the options/what you decide])
- **Less time sensitive; decision best handled by smaller group without entire team's input**
- A need for parallel tasks and speed is critical
- Smaller group has competence and motivation to take on the decision
- Decision/task will develop the individual

Consensus (I'd like everyone to get on the same page about X)
- **Less time sensitive; decision needs to be jointly owned and supported by team**
- Decision requires input from across the team
- Outcome will directly impact the team in significant ways
- Decision may not be implemented unless the team feels they have had a significant contribution in the decision-making process

### Overcome Bias with Reappraisal

Balancing Advocacy, Inquiry & Summary

Advocacy
- State views directly, while open to influence
- Be explicit about your reasoning, interests, concerns & conclusions
- Offer examples
- Make points one at a time

Inquiry
- Test your understanding
- Solicit a range of ideas
- Explore other's reasoning, concerns and interest
- Encourage challenge, questions and feedback

Summary
- Synthesize the others' views in your own words
- Test your understanding of the others' concerns
- Capture their full meaning; express their situation

### Decision Making Framework

Team Decisions: Consent vs Consensus

Consent
- Acquiescence or agree to a course of action without paramount assent
- Based on everyone’s range of tolerance rather than preference
- It's proposed we do X, does anyone feel strongly or have an strong opposing view?

Consensus
- Full agreement on the course of action, including almost all the details
- Requires negotiation of all details, full agreement
- Do we all agree that we should do X?

Other Challenges to Decision Making
- Unconscious Biases
- Emotional Triggers

Unconscious Biases Impede Quality Decisions
- Confirmation Bias: more likely to select information that supports pre-existing attitudes and beliefs
- Availability Bias: the tendency to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory
- Anchoring Effect:  the misconception that you analyze all factors before deciding, when first impressions affect perceptions and decisions
- Loss Aversion (status quo) Fallacy: prioritizing options by avoiding the potential for loss over pursuing the potential for gain
- In-group Bias: the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups

Emotional Triggers
- Experiencing threat or embarrassment creates a stress reaction
- Defensiveness, posturing or face-saving kick in
- May fear the issue will just get worse if it is raised

Overcoming Biases & Triggers Through Reappraisal
- Cognitive & Emotional - Attitudes that Impede
  - Push my point
  - What I see is how it is
  - I know I'm right
  - They need to figure it out
- Collaborative Mindset - Know and Feel to Overcome
  - I respond rather than react
  - I have one perspective of many
  - Suspend my agenda to listen
  - Best decision for the company

What (What are you solving for and are the objectives clear to everyone?)
- Address root causes, not situational fixes
- Establish priorities for what to tackle (and what's out of scope)
- Anticipate outcomes by defining success criteria at the onset
- Consider ways to simplify or tweak existing structures and look for solutions that scale

Why (What's at stake (if you do it or don't do it) and why is it important?)
- Does it solve a business need and/or good for the company longer term?
- Is this a good use of time?
- Does this fit in with other current priorities?

Who (Is everyone clear who the decision maker is?)
- Default to open: listen and ask questions
- Be generous with providing context—it’ll enable others to do their jobs better
- Give people the benefit of the doubt and assume positive intent

How (How will the decision be made? (e.g., consensus driven;  how will data be used))
- Define your exception criteria (which should rarely apply)
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Help scale good judgment by communicating the rationale for the decision after it is made

When (When can people expect a decision?)
- Be transparent about what decision was made and how it will be communicated
- If elements of the decision making process change or are delayed, communicate that to all stakeholders

### Add Clarity to Decisions with RACI

- R (Who is Responsible?) : The person who is assigned to do the work
- A (Who is Accountable?) : The person who makes the final decision and has the ultimate ownership
- C (Who is Consulted?) : The person who must be consulted before a decision or action is taken
- I (Who is Informed?) : The person who must be informed that a decision or action has been taken

Becoming the best kind of leader isn't about emulating a role model or a historic figure. Rather, your leadership must be rooted in who you are and what matters most to you. When you truly know yourself and what you stand for, it is much easier to know what to do in any situation. It always comes down to doing the right thing and doing the best you can.

### Getting to Know Your Direct Reports: Conversation Guide

STEP 1: Set Up the Meeting

Define the purpose of the meeting and set the intent that you want to get to know your directs better. Desired outcomes of the meeting include:
- Getting to know your report
- Building the relationship
- Understanding the support they would like from you
- Sharing of your career development philosophy and what they can expect from you

Set the tone and objective of the meeting:
- I'd like to spend some time in today's meeting getting to know each other better.
- We've gone through a lot of change recently and I want to understand your work style, your history, what you're passionate about, your career interest and goals, and how I can best support you. We won't cover everything today but I wanted to at least start the conversation.

STEP 2: Get to Know Your Employee

Purpose : Start to get to know your employee better and build the foundation of your employee / manager relationship.  Remember the purpose is to get to know your employee so listen more, talk less.

Pick the questions that resonate with you. You can also use these questions over several 1:1 sessions.

- Personal
  - What are your interests in both work and life?
  - Tell me a little about yourself. Your past work experiences. Where you went to school. The types of trainings you’ve completed.
  - What are your hobbies?  What do you like to do for fun?
- Work
  - What is your dream job in 10 years? Would that be different if money was no object?
  - What are some of the accomplishments you are most proud of (personally, in work)?
  - What are some of your biggest challenges?
  - What do you think are your natural strengths and talents?
  - What skills do you currently enjoy using either in your new or old role?
  - What are your current developmental goals?
  - What skills do you think we utilize?  What skills do you feel are unused?
- Working Style
  - Tell me about your working style.
  - What motivates you?
  - How do you like to be recognized?
  - Who is the best manager you've had and why?
  - How do you like to be managed (e.g., likes structure, loves autonomy, works best alone, wants to be part of a team)?

STEP 3: Open Up the Conversation

Purpose : While the objective is for you to get to know your direct report, it is important that they get to know you too.

Ask them: Is there anything you want to ask or know about me?

STEP 4: Wrap Up

Purpose : Summarize any action items and thank them for their time.

Wrap up the meeting:
- Thank you for sharing - I learned a lot about you and really look forward to working together.
- I will follow up on X as discussed.
- Let's keep this conversation going and remember I am here to support you.

In sports, many former athletes can tell stories about how a coach changed their life by identifying strengths, unlocking their potential, and encouraging them to persevere.

It is also important for managers to be able to flex their coaching styles - for example, the needs of individual team members may require them to be a "teaching" coach where the manager passes along an expertise to achieve something concrete, or a "facilitating coach" where the manager asks questions and listens instead of telling or giving answers.

Across the coaching continuum, here are some tips to share with your managers:
- Have regular 1:1s with your team member and be fully present and focused on the team member
- Be aware of your own mindset and that of the team member
- Practice active listening and ask open-ended questions to facilitate the team member’s own insight (questions that start with "what" and "how" encourage expansive thinking)
- Provide specific and timely feedback
- Balance positive (motivational) and negative (constructive) feedback and understand the unique strengths and development areas of each team member

### Hold effective 1:1 meetings

Set up a regular meeting
- Choose a consistent time, generally lasting 30-60 minutes, every week or two.
- Have the 1:1 meeting away from a conference room or desk - head outside for a walk.

Determine the agenda of the meeting
- Set up a shared agenda document to help structure your discussion time. Both the manager and team member should contribute.
- Here are some agenda items to get you started:
  - Check-in and catch-up questions: “What can I help you with?” and “What have you been up to?”
  - Roadblocks or issues
  - Goal updates
  - Administrative topics (e.g., upcoming vacations, expense reports)
  - Next steps to confirm actions and agreements
  - Career development and coaching

Meet for the 1:1
- Be on time.
- Stick to the agenda, whenever possible.
- Give the meeting your full attention.
- Ask for feedback: “Is there anything I should be doing for you that I am not doing?” or “Anything I should be doing better or more often?"
- Review action items and things to discuss in the next 1:1.
- Ask "What else?" (It's surprising to see what can come up as an afterthought!)
