### Emotional Intelligence: Cultivating Empathy & Compassion

How can I cultivate compassion?
- Ask how you can help, don’t assume you know what’s wanted
- Look for commonalities with your directs
- Encourage cooperation instead of competition in your team
- Cultivate a genuine curiosity about the individuals on your team
- Lead by example- treating others with compassion is contagious!
- Be mindful of boundaries— avoid being an emotional sponge

Why cultivate compassion?
- Too much empathy can cause stress & burnout for the empathizer
- Same brain regions are activated in the person suffering & empathizing
- VS. compassion, which instead produces feelings of concern, warmth, and motivation to help the other person
- Compassion training can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, and may even reduce your risk of heart disease
