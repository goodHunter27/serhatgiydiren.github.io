### Emotional Intelligence: Cultivating Empathy & Compassion

How can I cultivate compassion?
- Ask how you can help, don’t assume you know what’s wanted
- Look for commonalities with your directs
- Encourage cooperation instead of competition in your team
- Cultivate a genuine curiosity about the individuals on your team
- Lead by example- treating others with compassion is contagious!
- Be mindful of boundaries— avoid being an emotional sponge

Why cultivate compassion?
- Too much empathy can cause stress & burnout for the empathizer
- Same brain regions are activated in the person suffering & empathizing
- VS. compassion, which instead produces feelings of concern, warmth, and motivation to help the other person
- Compassion training can lower stress hormones, boost immunity, and may even reduce your risk of heart disease 

Four Types of Reappraisal
- Reinterpreting : How can I take the threat away from this situation?
- Normalizing : It's OK because others feel this way too
- Reordering : I'm going to think about the value I’m putting on this
- Repositioning : I'm going to consider this from another perspective

### Coaching Skills and GROW (Goal - Reality - Options - Will) Mode

- Best Questions: WHAT and HOW
- Info Questions: WHO, WHEN, WHERE
- Less: WHY

- Be fully present for and focused on the coachee
- Be aware of your own mindset and that of the coachee
- Practice empathic listening(aka active or reflective listening)
- Ask open-ended questions to facilitate coachee's own insight

### Stage 1 – GOAL

Help coachee articulate a specific meaningful goal, including what success would look like. It's rare to uncover the most meaningful / impactful goal in the first telling. It is the coach's job to delve more deeply to clarify the goal further.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- What do you want, desire, or need to overcome?
- What are your interests, values and motivations?
- What will success or achievement look or feel like?
- When will you know you have succeeded?
- How will you know you have succeeded?
- How important is this to you?

### Stage 2 – REALITY

Help coachee articulate the "here and now" so s/he can map the journey to the goal. Watch for trying to gather too much data; as coach you only need to understand general dynamics, how coachee interprets the situation, and the impact on him/her. Provide objectivity and invite coachee to see the situation from different angles.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- Where are you now with this topic?
- What makes you think that?
- What would your peers say about it?
- What obstacles are currently in the way of your success?
- What resources do you need to achieve your goal?

### Stage 3 – OPTIONS

Help coachee brainstorm a list of potential actions to move toward goal. Go for quantity rather than quality of ideas; quality eval comes later. Encourage creativity and brainstorm ALL potential ways to achieve goal before deciding on actions. Offer your ideas after coachee exhausts his/hers. Attribute equal weight to all ideas.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
- If your biggest obstacle wasn't there, what would you do?
- If you had endless resources, what would you do?
- What would your best friend, manager, or peer want or do in this situation?
- What can you do right now to further develop skills that would be useful in reaching your goal?
- What have helpful mentors done that has helped you progress?

### Stage 4 – WILL

Help coachee determine specific action plan s/he "owns" and follows to achieve the goal. This stage is about forward momentum and converting the discussion to a decision. Allow coachee to select relevant actions and decide how they want to be accountable.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS

- What will you do?
- On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to doing this? (If 6 or below, ask what would bring them to an 8-10.)
- What obstacles could arise? How will you overcome them?
- When will you start?
- How will you and I know it's been achieved or completed?
- Who will you ask for feedback after you've taken action?
- What advocacy would help? How can I provide more support towards your development?

Focused attention on coaching is more important than the time spent. What matters most is listening so the other person feels heard. Eliminate distractions and cultivate a sense of presence in the moment.

### Decision Making Styles

Tell (Let's do X)
- **Time critical; leader retains all control of final decision**
- Simple decision that needs to be acted on quickly
- Limited impact to team
- Leader has sufficient data or knows pertinent information
- Members' interests or objectivity will be compromised

Consult (Thanks for your input. I propose X. Anyone disagree?)
- **Time critical; leader retains all control of final decision**
- Ideas that need to be tested across the team
- Decision has greater impact on team, so involvement is necessary
- Members or others have expertise
- Leader has ideas they explicitly want input on before deciding
- Decision that needs greater buy-in and support

Delegate (I'd like [Person A] to look into this then tell me [the options/what you decide])
- **Less time sensitive; decision best handled by smaller group without entire team's input**
- A need for parallel tasks and speed is critical
- Smaller group has competence and motivation to take on the decision
- Decision/task will develop the individual

Consensus (I'd like everyone to get on the same page about X)
- **Less time sensitive; decision needs to be jointly owned and supported by team**
- Decision requires input from across the team
- Outcome will directly impact the team in significant ways
- Decision may not be implemented unless the team feels they have had a significant contribution in the decision-making process

### Overcome Bias with Reappraisal

Advocacy
- State views directly, while open to influence
- Be explicit about your reasoning, interests, concerns & conclusions
- Offer examples
- Make points one at a time

Inquiry
- Test your understanding
- Solicit a range of ideas
- Explore other's reasoning, concerns and interest
- Encourage challenge, questions and feedback

Summary
- Synthesize the others' views in your own words
- Test your understanding of the others' concerns
- Capture their full meaning; express their situation

### Decision Making Framework

What (What are you solving for and are the objectives clear to everyone?)
- Address root causes, not situational fixes
- Establish priorities for what to tackle (and what's out of scope)
- Anticipate outcomes by defining success criteria at the onset
- Consider ways to simplify or tweak existing structures and look for solutions that scale

Why (What's at stake (if you do it or don't do it) and why is it important?)
- Does it solve a business need and/or good for the company longer term?
- Is this a good use of time?
- Does this fit in with other current priorities?

Who (Is everyone clear who the decision maker is?)
- Default to open: listen and ask questions
- Be generous with providing context—it’ll enable others to do their jobs better
- Give people the benefit of the doubt and assume positive intent

How (How will the decision be made? (e.g., consensus driven;  how will data be used))
- Define your exception criteria (which should rarely apply)
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Help scale good judgment by communicating the rationale for the decision after it is made

When (When can people expect a decision?)
- Be transparent about what decision was made and how it will be communicated
- If elements of the decision making process change or are delayed, communicate that to all stakeholders

### Add Clarity to Decisions with RACI

- R (Who is Responsible?) : The person who is assigned to do the work
- A (Who is Accountable?) : The person who makes the final decision and has the ultimate ownership
- C (Who is Consulted?) : The person who must be consulted before a decision or action is taken
- I (Who is Informed?) : The person who must be informed that a decision or action has been taken
